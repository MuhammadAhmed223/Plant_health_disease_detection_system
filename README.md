# 🌿 Plant Health Disease Detection System

# 🚀 Overview
    The Plant Health Disease Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and classify plant diseases from images of leaves. This system empowers farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers by providing accurate and timely detection of plant health issues, helping to prevent crop loss and improve agricultural productivity.

# 📸 Key Features
    🌱 Disease Detection: Identifies plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning models.
    🎨 Image Processing: Utilizes advanced image preprocessing techniques for better accuracy.
    📊 Real-Time Prediction: Fast and efficient predictions with user-friendly outputs.
    📈 Model Training: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
    🛠 Customizable: Easily adaptable to other plant types and diseases with new datasets.

# 🖼 How It Works
    Image Input: Users upload an image of a plant leaf.
    Preprocessing: The image undergoes resizing, normalization, and other transformations.
    Prediction: The trained deep learning model classifies the image into disease categories or healthy.
    Result Output: The system displays the predicted disease name with confidence scores.

# 🔧 Tech Stack
    Programming Language: Python
    Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch
    Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
    Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    Notebook: Jupyter (for model training and testing)

# 📦 Installation
    Clone this repository:
      git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAhmed223/Plant_health_disease_detection_system.git
      cd Plant_health_disease_detection_system

    Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

      pip install -r requirements.txt


# 📊 Dataset
    The project utilizes a dataset of plant leaf images categorized by health status and type of disease. You can use the PlantVillage Dataset or any similar dataset.

# 🧪 Usage
    Upload an image of a plant leaf.
    The system will process the image and predict whether the plant is healthy or affected by a disease.
    View detailed results and suggestions for treatment.
